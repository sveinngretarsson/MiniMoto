Hobby project, learning the inner workings of the Texas Instrument TM4C123G and LAUNCHXL-F28027 controllers.
The contraption to be controlled can be described as two small wheeles attached to the midsection of a plane.

Turning is performed by skid-steering. Model of the motors and the dynamic model of the body to be moved will
be created at a later date.

The initial steps for this project is to get a good foundation for how this particular DSP works. The scripts
and functions that will be written here will cover everything from GPIO toggle to PWM output to the driver
H-bridge.
